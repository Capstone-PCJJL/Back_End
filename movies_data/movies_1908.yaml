    sent a message to his wife that his friend Smith was ill, and it was his duty
    to perform that spiritual work of mercy, "comfort the afflicted," hence he would
    not have her wait up for him as he might be late. Smith did likewise, using Thompson
    as the object of his humane consideration. This done, they start off to make a
    night of it. First they visit the gilded throne room of a temple of Bacchus, where
    they moisten their parched spirits with dry Martinis. They are soon in a most
    glorious condition. Smith suggests the show where "Amateur Night" is on.  - Written

  overview: The widowed elderly mother of three adult children, two sons and a daughter,
    wishing to relieve herself of the burden of care of her property, decides to divide
    it up among her children. To her son Charles, a wild but kind young fellow, she
    leaves a small amount, feeling that he will soon run through it. The good-hearted
    boy is perfectly satisfied, believing in the wisdom of his mother's actions. He
    assumes she will find a home with one of his siblings, who are married and settled.
    The old woman moves in with her married son, but is driven out by his wife over
    an argument about her young granddaughter. She is forced to move into a squalid
    apartment in a cheap tenement house, but is evicted for failing to pay her rent.

    a bit later we see a young man pull out a violin he has been hiding and start
    to play it. The film then flashes to another location but this is where it cuts

    just a few seconds short of four minutes as several women are dressed up as bees
    dancing around their hive. The "Queen Bee" goes to take a nap and she's attacked
    by a spider. The spider sequence is what gets this film a mention by fantasy fans
    but sadly this scene takes place around the 3:13 mark and lasts just a few seconds.

    that is seated beside the table, and when the fellow blows his breath on the animal
    he falls over unconscious from the effects. Next he prostrates a street cleaner
    and a painter perched on a ladder, as well as a woman in charge of a newsstand.
    They all succumb and fall over unconscious on the ground. He enters the subway
    and meets a man coming up the stairs, and when the latter gets a whiff of the
    garlic he too, goes down in a heap. Entering the car in the underground road he
    proceeds to waft the strong odor over the passengers, with the effect that each
    in turn goes down and out on the floor of the coach. When he reaches the next
    station he alights, leaving the car looking more like a hospital than anything.

    make the scene so realistic that they get themselves into all kinds of trouble
    in the city where people are not familiar with their mode of doing things. The
    first picture shows the camera set to take a picture of a tragic hold-up. The
    manager gets the people in position, and when they are ready, a woman and girl
    are seen walking along the street, when three men spring out from behind a wall,
    and, after stabbing them, go through their pockets, relieving them of all their
    valuables.

    the fun begins. It is all accomplished through some clever trick photography.
    First we see two attendants start out to do a cleaning job, and while they stop
    to take some refreshments, two men, who happen to be passing, take the machine
    and start down the sheet to have some fun. They meet a woman with a dog on a leash,
    and at a turn of the wheel, the dog and its mistress are quickly drawn into the
    spout. Next a nursemaid comes sauntering down the street, and when they level
    the spout at her she meets the same fate. A girl and her lover are the next to
    disappear off the face of the earth, and still they go along, looking for more
    victims. (Moving Picture World)

    capable of withstanding the shock, she contracts a cold. By the time the maid
    gets her home she is extremely ill, and her mother puts her to bed and sends for
    a doctor, who, upon arriving, prescribes and pronounces her case as serious. The

    bound for a dangerous expedition takes leave of his wife, and the poor woman is
    seen following with dim eyes the departing ship, her heart apparently heavy with
    grief. After having cried and prayed on a cross, the grass-widow returns to the
    farm to resume her duties and takes a sack of wheat to the next mill. The miller,
    knowing of the sailor's departure, and finding the lass very agreeable and charming,
    after having seen to the wheat bag, gives his whole attention to the young woman,
    and he does not seem to mind very much the clumsy advances made by the workingman.
    They part after a rather excited confab, and have evidently made an appointment
    for the evening at the church, for it is a Christmas celebration. We follow the
    two young people in the chapel, then to a bonfire dance, and lastly we see them

  overview: A woman attorney is seen in her apartment with her poor henpecked husband,
    who is more like her man servant than her better half. She is so taken up with
    her studies in law that she finds no time to bother with household duties, thus
    putting the burden on her husband who is compelled to take care of the baby, clean
    the house, do the cooking and be on hand, ready to answer whenever the wife calls
    on him to attend to her wants. Things do not run very smoothly, however, which
    is not at all surprising, so she finally decides to take a hand in the domestic
    affairs herself. (Moving Picture World)

  overview: Mr. Nearbright is busily engaged writing; consults his watch. His wife,
    accompanied by her "Ma" enters, attired for a journey, carrying small satchels.
    The husband rises, apparently delighted, and bids them good-bye. When the ladies
    have gone, Mr. Nearbright rushes to the telephone, gives a message which is gratifying,
    to all appearances. The door opens, and a friend, Mr. Flirt, enters, followed
    by other members of a "stag" club.

  overview: This is a frustrating watch as there looks to be some great filmmaking
    there, but a number of scenes (including the beginning and end) are missing, the
    print is in poor condition. It looks very nice though and the production values
    are once again quite high, but the current presentation is a shame.

  overview: 'The Germans were not far behind when if came to experimenting with sound
    and the surviving discs seem like a curious anachronism because they closely resemble
    the Vitaphone discs from the mid-1920s: about sixteen inches in diameter and the
    track started from the center and the needle moved out.'
