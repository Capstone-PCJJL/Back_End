  overview: The formal name of the peep show machine was the Mutoscope -- at least

    became simply "Biograph" and is best remembered for the films directed by D.W.
    Griffith with G.W. "Billy" Bitzer as him cameraman.  At this point, however, Griffith
    was a struggling stage actor and Bitzer was a leading cameraman for Biograph.
    This meant that he did all sorts of movies, including peep shows, and this is
    one of them. The title tells all and the show shows a lot as a woman exposes a
    shapely limb and is punished for her flouting of decent behavior.

    to his aid and he is assisted by others. They strive to pull the man out by a
    rope let down, but the rope breaks and he falls back to the bottom of the well
    while his rescuers topple over backwards. They call the firemen to aid the drowning
    man. There is nothing more comical than the sight of the extraordinary methods
    employed by these latter for extricating the hapless janitor from his sorry condition.
    Doctor Deathcheater applies a marvelous treatment--which had remained a profound
    secret up to that time-to cause the drowned man to eject the water he had swallowed.
    He is promptly restored to life, happy at having escaped death so cheaply.

  overview: A fisherman has taken a comfortable position on the bank of a river; he
    has thrown his line into the water to see what good fortune awaits him. But the
    heat is so intense that he becomes drowsy, and finally he is lulled to sleep by
    the murmur of the gently flowing current of the stream. His rest is disturbed
    by strange dreams, and as a result of a sudden movement he pitches into the water.
    A policeman who happens to be passing at this moment rushes to his aid, but the
    angler has already gained the shore before assistance reaches him, and the latter
    immediately starts to return to his house to change his clothes. During that time,
    the policeman, who has jumped into the river, is overtaken by two officers, who
    arrest him, thinking that he has been bathing in a place where it is forbidden.
    They lead the poor man away to the station-house without concerning themselves
    about the fact that he is a representative of the public force.

    a broad sidewalk in the business district of a large city, probably New York.
    As the action begins, a woman dressed in the fashion of the time is seen approaching
    the camera position. She stops in front of the window of a mercantile store. While
    she is scrutinizing the merchandise, a purse snatcher comes from the rear, grabs
    her handbag, turns, and makes off with it in the opposite direction. The woman
    causes quite a commotion, waves her arms and yells attracting a large crowd, including
    some policemen. The cameraman changed his position and the last scene shows the
    woman, escorted by two policemen and followed by a group of people, walking down
    the sidewalk into a building that might be a police station.

    thief sneaks up and snatches their booty which he successfully vets away with,
    The two prowlers accuse each other of the theft of the booty and come to most

  overview: I'm not sure why the negotiations that ended the Russo-Japanese War of
    1904-5 took place in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, but President Theodore Roosevelt
    had been flexing the United States' power in the world. He had offered to mediate
    an end to the the war. Russia agreed because of the shocking losses they had suffered
    at Mukden and Tsushima, and the naval revolt in Odessa. Japan had agreed because
    they feared a drawn-out war would cripple them financially. Besides, the treaty's
    terms gave them control of Korea. This film documents the world leaders presence
    in Portsmouth with military parades and naval ships.

  overview: A man in black tie and tails enters a high-society parlor where a settee
    sits beneath an open window. He goes to the window and gestures to someone. From
    outside, a man in a burglar's outfit (watch cap, wide striped shirt, and dark
    jacket) appears and gets his instructions from the man in tails. A woman wearing
    a jeweled tiara enters with a second man who leaves her in the company of our
    mastermind. He sits her on the settee, chats her up, leaning toward her with one
    arm curling behind her head.
