    the eruption are plain to be seen. Thousands upon thousands of tons of molten
    lava, sand, rocks and steam are thrown high in the air and descend with crushing
    force upon the unfortunate inhabitants of the doomed city of St. Pierre. This
    is the worst calamity which occurred since a similar eruption by Mt. Vesuvius
    when Pompeii was destroyed. (Lubin Catalog)

  overview: The setting of this fantastic scene represents the hall of an old chateau
    in which a miser has locked up seven large bags containing his wealth. Satan,
    who has made his way into the chateau, puts the seven bags in a strong box, and
    makes with his hands some cabalistic motions. The miser comes into the hall and
    is greatly astonished to find his fortune missing. He opens the coffer and immediately
    the bags leap out. He gathers them up and puts them back into the coffer. When
    he opens it again he finds that they have been transformed into seven young girls,
    who rush out and chase after him, beating him unmercifully. They shut him up in
    the coffer from which his gold has vanished. The miser pushes open the lid of
    the coffer, and to his profound despair finds that both young girls and money
    have disappeared. (This view is most sensational in its mysterious scenes.) (Star

    The picture commences with Samson's visit to Gaza, a city of the Philistines.
    While there they closed the gates upon him and set watchmen to defend them, intending
    to put him to death on the following day. Samson slept until midnight, and then
    arose. Upon reaching the gates, he slew the watchman, pulled down the gates and
    carried them to the top of an adjoining hill, where he left them to the confusion
    and disappointment of the Philistines. After many feats of this kind, Samson permitted
    himself to become infatuated with a treacherous woman among the Philistines, named
    Delilah. He revealed to her that the secret of his strength lay in the fact that,
    being a Nazarite, he never had cut his hair. After hearing this, she waited until
    Samson was asleep, and then having cut off his seven locks, called out that the
    Philistines were coming.

    despair, a cross appears on the rock, showing at first thinly, but gradually growing
    clear until it stands out in bold relief. The maiden then takes new courage and
    throwing her arms about the cross, clings to it in safety, while the waves continue

    Malabares", which were filmed during the exhibition of the Malabari, an Indian
    tribe from the Malabar  region, in the Jardin d''Acclimatation from August 15
    to October 5, 1902. In this film, the Malabars perform various acrobatic exercises.
    Some dance on a rope stretched at the end of two bamboos stuck in the ground,
    carry on their head in perfect balance a pile of earthenware vessels. Others climb
    like monkeys with a surprising agility, perform the dance of GUYARATIS birds,
    scratch their heads, peck the ground.'

    Bull Ring market, capturing an array of local characters, including a cheery fishwife.
    Children and members of the Royal Irish Constabulary mingle with the traders and
    customers. The Mayor of Wexford, in his official regalia, appears with his daughters.
    The films were later shown at the Theatre Royal, Wexford.  This film was shot
    during a two-day visit to the South East Ireland town by Mitchell and Kenyon cameraman
    Louis De Clercq. The man in the pale hat seen walking arm-in-arm with another
    man towards the camera may be Hugh McCarthy, manager of Wexford's White Hotel.
    The same man reappears later, alongside the mayor and his daughters.

  overview: A man and a woman, both dressed in rough clothing, go around and around,
    half dancing and half wrestling, until they tumble to the ground in a heap.  The
    Apache dance was named not after the Indians of the American Southwest, but the
    lower class demimondaines of Paris. Acts like this were popular because they permitted
    their audiences to go slumming, attending events that looked and seemed risky
    but in truth were not.  Acts like this were part of the reason that public dancing
    was often seen as disreputable. Polite society restricted their dancing to private
    parties where dances like the waltz and polka -- which had been shocking half
    a century earlier -- were performed. It would take the influence of Vernon and
    Irene Castle and the rise of night clubs during Prohibition to make public dancing
    respectable again.  In the meantime, there's this. It's not very graceful.

    the second story window to the sidewalk. She jumps to her feet, more angry than
    hurt, and to get even, pulls the porter and ladder over backwards; but he is evidently
    made of India rubber, for as soon as he strikes the ground the ladder bounds upright
    again with him on the top. He then empties a large pail of water on the housekeeper's
    head to cool her temper. A very humorous film.

    but finally decide to place it on the fence, directly opposite or on a level with
    that part of the washerwoman on which she sits down. The shooters take aim and
    fire and the shot, penetrating the fence, strikes the woman amidships and precipitates
    her into the tub. This is more than she can stand and she goes for the man, throwing
    him down and beating him about the head with a bucket. He manages to get away
    and tries to climb a tree but the washerwoman's dog makes a dash for him and fastens
    his teeth in the bosom of the young man's trousers. The woman then throws the
    tub at him and strikes him in the back of the neck.

  overview: This picture was taken from the front end of a train during a trip from
    the famous Cliff House to Bakers Beach along the shore of the Golden Gate. The
    train runs along the brink of the cliff and gives a perfect representation of
    the objects that meet the eye prior to entering the Golden Gate. One of the features
    of this picture is the stirring ride along the very edge of the cliff, the track
    being laid in places within a foot of the brink, and far below can be seen the
    huge breakers dashing against the foot of the cliff. (Edison Catalog)
