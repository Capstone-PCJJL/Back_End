    lot of good-hearted simple folks places them in a rather embarrassing position.
    Lillie Green, who keeps a boarding house, receives a letter from her old school
    chum, Polly Brown, whom sin hasn't seen in years, to the effect that as Lillie
    has never seen her little darling daughter, she will send her for a few days'
    visit, asking that someone meet the child at the 3:40 train. Lillie's boarders
    are a bunch of kind-hearted bachelors, who at once prepare to give the "Little
    Darling" the time of her life, buying a load of toys, etc., for her amusement,
    also procuring a baby carriage with which to meet her at the train. You may imagine
    their embarrassment when they find that Tootsie, instead of being a baby, proves
    to be a handsome young lady of seventeen, whose tastes run rather to garden gates,
    shady lanes and quiet nooks, than toys. (Moving Picture World)

    Thunder Cloud, is beloved by Comata, a Sioux brave, but having met and listened
    to the persuasion of Bud Watkins, a cowboy, leaves her mountain home to become
    his squaw. Poor little confiding Clear Eyes lives only for Bud, and he at first
    seems devoted to her, but at the end of two years, a little papoose arriving meanwhile
    to bless their union, he tires of her, and courts Miss Nellie Howe, a white girl,
    who thinks him single. Comata, however, has unremittingly watched his movements,
    and vows to avenge his lost one. Following him to the white girl's home, he sees
    enough to convince him of the whelp's villainy, so he goes and reveals the truth
    to Clear Eyes.

    that he thinks it is hers. On examining the handkerchief, the beauty returns it,
    telling George that it does not belong to her. He then confesses that he knows
    very well that it is not her property, as it happens to be his own, and his offering
    it to her was only an excuse to make her acquaintance, so struck was he by her
    beauty. Upon this frank declaration the young woman draws herself up haughtily,
    but George is not to be discouraged, but follows closely behind her, ready to
    be of any assistance on the slightest pretext. We therefore see him arriving at
    the lady's house laden down with such articles as a lampshade, a statuette, a
    bunch of roses, a bundle of dress goods, and, in addition, leading an enormous
    dog on a leash, against whose attacks he is endeavoring to protect himself.

    with an unidentified passenger cut to shots of onlookers on the ground, presumably
    military and press liaisons. The aircraft is shown in side-to-side flybys as well
    as low-altitude passes directly toward and away from the camera.  The aerial shots
    begin at the 1:34 mark immediately after a shot of the aircraft coming to a landing
    directly approaching the camera. (Wikipedia)

    fragrant leaves must pass, before they are ready for the smoker, form the interesting
    theme of this beautiful colored picture. The first scene shows the young plants
    growing close together, and the transplanting as they increase in size. The soil
    is poor for anything but tobacco, and one wonders how a good crop may be obtained
    in such poor land. We are shown, successively, the natives picking the largest
    leaves the inspection of the picking, and the natives carrying bundles of green
    tobacco to the tallying room.

  overview: This remarkable ape, extraordinarily human-like in its manners and ways,
    gives a splendid exhibition. When first seen Adam appears to be in a rather morose
    mood in a chair. The weather is so hot that at the suggestion of the professor
    Adam removes his coat and gratefully accepts a fan. The question of dinner is
    then discussed and Adam focuses his attention on the bill of fare with all the
    interest of an epicure. A bottle of wine is shared by the two friends, the ape
    seeing to it that he gets his. After dinner a game of cards, followed by a pipe,
    with which we will leave him, although we have described only a few of his many
    accomplishments.

  overview: Jenny's father, a crank and a spiritualist, wishing to obtain a medium
    to aid him in his researches, inserts an advertisement in the paper to the effect
    that he desires to marry his daughter to a medium. Jenny thereupon runs away with
    her lover, Reggie, and the two concoct a little plan by which they can get married.
    Disguised as a Turk, Reggie calls and states he is willing to marry the spiritualist's
    daughter. Jenny's father is distracted at the loss of his daughter, so he begs
    the supposed medium to trace his daughter by occult means. Needless to say this
    is not a difficult matter to Reggie, who after leading the spiritualist a wild-goose
    chase over the country, brings him back to his own home (to which Jenny has returned
    in the meantime) and shows him his daughter hidden away in a cupboard. Tableau
    of delighted father, unmasking and blessings on the young couple.
