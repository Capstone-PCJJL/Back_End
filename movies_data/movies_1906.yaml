    to early German film artistry, The Story of the Kelly Gang (1906) symbolizes both
    the birth of the Australian film industry and the emergence of an Australian cinema
    identity. Even more significantly, it heralds the emergence of the feature film
    format. However, only fragments of the original production of more than one hour
    are known to exist, preserved at the National Film and Sound Archive, Canberra;
    Efforts at reconstruction have made the film available to modern audiences.

    together so that more than one scene and more than one vantage are included. We
    see fire raging. We see burned-out buildings, piles of rubble, and buildings with
    only one wall standing. People stand and watch; others walk purposely through
    the debris. A carriage passes; the camera pans the desolation. A horse-drawn cart
    is laden with a family''s remaining possessions. A sign hangs outside one building:
    "A little disfigured but still in business. Men Wanted."'

  overview: In 1906, the Arlberg Railway, which connects the Austrian cities of Innsbruck
    and Bludenz, is the only east-west mountain railway in Austria. This 340-second
    "ghost railroad ride" shows the view from the back of a train, though I'm not
    sure if it's heading east or west. This kind of film, in vogue at the time, is
    an intermediate form of short reality, which often showed a train engaging in
    a bend, and a feature documentary. Its editing is live, linear and temporal, and
    the cuts are very apparent. Indeed, the choices of where to place the cuts seem
    to have avoided the less populated stretches. There are plenty of buildings to
    see, even when the train is not at the station.

    an early filmic reminder of their huge importance to both Scottish national identity
    and the thriving tourist industry north of the border.  The film's unique selling
    point was that pioneering filmmaker G. A. Smith showed off the vibrant designs
    in Kinemacolor, among the earliest colour film processes that didn't involve meticulous
    hand-painting. And no dangly bits in sight.

    ride their horses, first over low hedges, then over increasingly rough terrain,
    until by the end they are sliding down hills to cross a stream and going into
    caves. The horses don't seem terribly anixous to do these things. Occasionally
    a rider falls off and the horse walks away, as if to say "See! I told you this
    wasn't a good idea."

    each playing a different musical instrument. A moment later, they all vanish and
    we are left with the troubadour who we were first introduced to at the beginning
    of the film. He explodes in a puff of smoke, and an enormous fan appears and unfolds.
    On it appears a vision of a castle tower with a maiden in it, and the troubadour
    outside the tower window, talking to her. The vision dissolves, and the troubadour
    bows, thus ending his performance.

  overview: Modern Americans think that the movies learned to talk in 1927 when Al
    Jolson opened his mouth in THE JAZZ SINGER, but sound pictures had a much longer
    history. Edison envisaged combining the phonograph with motion pictures even before
    they had been perfected and there is a test sequence from 1895. By the time this
    'phonoscene' had been made, Alice Guy had been directing a series of them and
    there was a series in production in Germany, too. Yet true synchronization remained
    a problem, what with records wearing out and film breaking until the perfection
    of sound on film itself.
