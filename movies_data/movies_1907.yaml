  overview: Devilish looking man dances with a dress in his arms. The dress stands
    up by itself and a woman magician appears in it. She conjures six women and then
    makes them disappear. She magically changes into men's clothing and lines up six
    boxes which begin to smoke and produce six women, whose clothing transforms from
    formal gowns to ballet dresses. The magician makes them disappear. She then lines
    up six glasses on a table, and, as she pours wine into them, a woman appears in
    each glass. She makes the wine go back into the container and everything on the
    table goes up in smoke. She transforms her clothing into a dress, then disappears,
    leaving the dress standing on its own. The devilish man reappears, turns the dress
    into torches, then disappears into smoke with the torches. (Library of Congress)

    are still known based on contemporary newspaper advertisements of the film.  As
    the name would indicate, the film tells about two local men who are making moonshine
    in the woods. A customer comes to them, and while sampling the product they start
    a game of cards, which eventually leads to a fight. While the fight is going on,
    the local police shows up and arrests the makers while the customer manages to

  overview: The story of a little girl and her pets, a horse and a dog, whose marvelous
    intelligence is most strikingly shown. The little girl, whose home is at the seaside,
    goes out on the rocks to play with her dog. There she romps with her pet and quite
    loses sight of the constantly rising tide. Suddenly she discovers that the rocks
    are surrounded, and her escape entirely cut off. Turning to her dog, she motions
    him to the land; instantly he is off, swimming to shore and dashing across the
    beach. He reaches the stable, where he unties the pet horse, then leading the
    way, he and the horse dash off to the surf, through which they plunge. The horse
    soon reaches the rock, which he has much difficulty in approaching, but finally
    the little girl succeeds in getting upon his back, and is then swiftly borne to
    shore.

    seen, it opens up and different parts of a sketch which are enclosed therein,
    mysteriously fly from it upon the canvas until finally all the parts resemble
    the image of a man. When completed, the picture becomes animated and comes down
    upon the ground and engages in some merry antics with its own skeleton which shortly
    after is changed into a lady. After frolicking around for an interval, the man
    is changed to a sketch on the canvas; then it begins to dismember itself, one
    portion at the time. After all the parts of the sketch are in the portfolio, it
    folds itself up; then the animated person appears from some mysterious source
    and carries off the portfolio in which his own image is enclosed.

    bed. Pulling this a few blocks, he is exhausted and lies down on the bed to rest.
    He is soon the center of attraction, and the crowd continues to gather, when the
    police order him away, and as he refuses to move he is started off by the officers,
    who guide him for a time, but are forcibly deterred by indignant citizens from
    further interference. The impecunious man and his bed, which gains momentum as
    it runs down the inclines, cause much excitement en route, and finally arrive
    at the business center, where it comes to a stop alongside the walk. Our friend
    has purloined a fur coat and an auto horn on his tour, and now presents a modern
    chauffeur. (Gaumont catalogue)

    A rapid stamping alerts their companions, who prepare the lassos; the ropes whistle,
    wind around the necks of the panicked beasts, which take a few more steps then,
    strangled and panting, are brought back captive. In the evening, they camp. Large
    fires are lit around which men and beasts settle down to sleep, not without a
    good guard being kept in the surrounding area. Meanwhile, the Apaches creep under
    cover of night to the American camp and succeed in seizing the captured beasts.
    Following this abduction, a frantic pursuit begins across the vast solitude of

  overview: A battle between two forces takes place. There's no information on this
    4-minute film aside from the fact that it was available from Charles Urban's Urban
    Trading Company, one of the most vigorous of British film production and distribution
    companies in the era. It's a well-composed and edited piece for 1907. The uniforms
    of the opposing forces, one in dark uniforms and one in white, under battle standards
    with the Union Jack look good. The field pieces and the medics transporting the
    wounded are likewise believable, although the compositions, if anything, look
    too good for it to have been war games; likewise, the smoke from the artillery
    obscures the action.

  overview: The first picture shows seven gigantic pachyderms being brushed down,
    cleaned, marcelled, manicured, etc. by their keepers. The toilet completed, the
    huge quadrupeds are next seen at exercise, where, at the word of their director,
    they execute a number of wonderfully intelligent stunts, among which are lying
    down limp, rolling over, balancing and posing. In the next view two of the largest
    of the herd are pitted against each other in a ramming contest. A mahout mounted
    on each beast, they place their heads together and each endeavors to push the
    other back. The last view given is that of the elephants mounting a gangway to
    the top of a chute, from which each goes sliding down the way, finally splashing
    into a pond.

  overview: An artist is seen in his studio, apparently waiting his periodical remittance,
    which is long past due. After some thought, he decides to sell one of his pictures.
    He first goes to an art dealer's, only to find that his painting is not wanted,
    the man directing him instead to a junk dealer. He goes to this merchant, who
    tells him he may find a demand for his picture in a liquor saloon nearby. Meanwhile
    a letter-carrier with a special letter which must have the signature of the artist,
    has called at his quarters and has been directed by the Janitor to the art dealer's
    store. Panting and out of breath, he reaches the store, but here is sent on to
    the junk dealer's. Dashing in just as the artist has left, the junk man directs
    him to the saloon, but the same circumstances attend him there, and he follows
    the artist to the home of a lady where the artist had gone to dispose of his picture,
    but finds that he is too late and starts back to the home of the artist once more.

  overview: Showing the progress of the natives from barbarism to industrial development.
    This unique and beautiful series contains the best photographic results of two
    expeditions through British North Borneo. The expeditions penetrated 127 miles
    into the interior, some parts of which had never previously been trodden by white
    men, and the journey bristled with difficulties. The series illustrates not only
    the commercial enterprise of the British North Borneo Company, but also the quaint
    manners and strange customs of the natives.
