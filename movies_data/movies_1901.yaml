  overview: Filmed in 35mm and in black and white, this short silent film was produced
    by the English film pioneer R. W. Paul, and directed by Walter R. Booth and was
    filmed at Paul's Animatograph Works. It was released in November 1901. As was
    common in cinema's early days, the filmmakers chose to adapt an already well-known
    story, in this case A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens, in the belief that the
    audience's familiarity with the story would result in the need for fewer intertitles.
    It was presented in 'Twelve Tableaux' or scenes. The film contains the first use
    of intertitles in a film.

  overview: Our presidential hunter runs across the landscape and falls down in the
    snow, gets up with his rifle, and gazes upward at a treed animal which isn't in
    the camera's view. He fires a shot into the tree, then leaps on the ground to
    grab the fallen prey, a domestic cat, finishing it off with wild blows of his
    hunting knife while his companions, a photographer and a press agent, record the
    event that will be reported far and wide as a manly moment. Teddy then rides out
    of the forest followed by two companions afoot, never mind that they all originally
    arrived afoot. Perhaps it was funnier in its day than it is now, but apparently
    shooting cats was regarded as funny in those days. The larger point was to use
    a minor whimsy as a political criticism, in this case of Teddy Roosevelt's easy
    manipulations of the press. It was based on two frames of a political cartoon
    that had appeared in the paper a mere week before the film was made.

    the picture, and begins smearing a whitewash brush over the canvas, when lo, a
    most perfect image of the young lady appears. The image then steps down from the
    frame, joins the young lady in the studio, and the figures, each a perfect counterpart
    of the other begin to dance to the great astonishment of the artist. The clown
    the by waving his hand causes the figures of the two girls to merge into one.
    The artist then assumes his seat and awakens from his dream with a great shock.

    The scene opens in the bedroom of a hotel. A traveler appears, evidently a "little
    worse for wear." After stretching and yawning, he proceeds to disrobe. He throws
    off his coat and vest, but to his surprise and anguish, he suddenly finds himself
    clothed in a continental uniform. He throws this off in anger, but immediately
    a policeman's costume flies on him. This is in turn thrown aside in great rage
    and he finds himself clothed in a soldier's uniform. At last, thinking himself
    successful, he makes for the bed and finds a skeleton complacently resting on
    his pillow. The bed suddenly disappears, leaving him seated on the floor, and
    great quantities of bed clothes rain down from the ceiling. The picture ends leaving
    the audience simply convulsed in laughter. (Edison Catalog)

    nose several playing cards, Mascarille enlarges these cards and transforms them
    into the flags of all nations. From these flags he extricates a group of beauties.
    The nobleman begins to pay court to the ladies. Instantly the group disappears
    and the lord finds himself face to face with an animated Sun, who starts in a
    grotesque dance. The Sun is changed to a pumpkin. Then the devil appears, replaces

  overview: In 1953, in an old cabinet of a former photographer from Zermatt, a first
    mountaineering film was found. It was a silent film from the first era showing
    the ascent of the Matterhorn by a group of guides across the Hornli ridge. The
    film is attributed to the American Frederick Burlingham and dated 1901 and is
    therefore the first mountaineering film in history. The story of the discovery
    was also dressed in a certain aura of legend and mystery as it was told that the
    original copy of the film had been lost forever in a shipwreck in the Atlantic
    and was the only copy printed that remained. The film was renamed Cervin 1901
    or Cervino 1901, and in 2014, after being restored again. But the truth is that
    this whole story, which has somehow held together throughout this period, is full
    of inaccuracies...

    the Chief and his driver. Next comes a chemical engine mounted on a stout double
    runner sled, which is followed closely by hose carriage apparatus mounted also
    on double runner sleds. Next comes a water tower mounted on a set of double runners
    and drawn by four beautiful horses. This is followed very closely by an engine
    drawn by a four-horse string team. This is followed by another engine on double
    runners, drawn by a four-horse tandem team. A second hose carriage and a Protective
    Insurance outfit brings up the rear. The breath leaves the horses' nostrils in
    great white puffs as they gallop through the snow-covered streets.

  overview: With the exception of this film there are absolutely no genuine moving
    picture films representing genuine prize fights on the market. The prize fight
    films, so-called, are either taken by the fight promoters and retained by them
    for exhibition, not on sale and cannot be procured, or else they are the boldest
    fake reproductions put up the day following the fight by cheap, so-called fighters,
    who endeavor, to the best of their ability and under the direction of the enterprising
    photographer, to represent or reproduce as nearly as possible the scrap which
    occured the evening before between the genuine principles. It is easy to see how
    very little real value films produced in these ways possess for the average public,
    which quick to see that the so-called priniples in the fight are not the men they
    are advertised to be, and the fight is not the real thing.

    can see here an early phase of the evolution of Northern Union rules: note the
    quickly-formed scrum after each tackle. Shots along the touchline show officials
    and spectators transfixed by the play, while others are distracted by the camera.  The
    Northern Rugby Football Union, better known as Northern Union, was formed in 1895,
    when prominent Yorkshire and Lancashire clubs resigned from the Rugby Football
    Union in a dispute over compensation for players taking time off work. All the
    major differences between the two codes would be established by 1907.'

    into the barrel on top of the second table. They then jump backwards onto the

  overview: With the exception of this film there are absolutely no genuine moving
    picture films representing genuine prize fights on the market. The prize fight
    films, so-called, are either taken by the fight promoters and retained by them
    for exhibition, not on sale and cannot be procured, or else they are the boldest
    fake reproductions put up the day following the fight by cheap, so-called fighters,
    who endeavor, to the best of their ability and under the direction of the enterprising
    photographer, to represent or reproduce as nearly as possible the scrap which
    occured the evening before between the genuine principles. It is easy to see how
    very little real value films produced in these ways possess for the average public,
    which quick to see that the so-called priniples in the fight are not the men they
    are advertised to be, and the fight is not the real thing.

  overview: This scene was taken shortly after the completion of the railroad in 1899.
    The impression received by the audience is that of riding on the pilot of an engine.
    Shortly after starting, you plunge into the darkness of the tunnel, afterwards
    to emerge, and crossing a high trestle skirting the edge of a deep chasm, you
    continue to wind about among the mountains and gorges. The ice-covered peaks of
    the distant mountains form an ever changing background.

    big enough that Mitchell and Kenyon's cameraman needed several different positions
    to capture just some of its workers outside the factory gates. The smaller children
    waiting for their families may before long have ended up working there themselves.

  overview: Nearly a century after Nelson's famous victory, the British were still
    celebrating his achievements and by extension the British Navy, which had secured
    the Empire ever since. Here, a dizzying array of naval officers, cadets, Lascars
    and crews from the Liverpool-based merchant marine (the Allan Line, Cunard and
    the Elder Dempster Co.) march past after a stirring speech from the Lord Mayor.  The
    grand procession, organised by the Liverpool branch of the Navy League, is testimony
    to an era when Britain's navy was the undisputed ruler of the seas. Some black
    sailors are visible among the marchers; they are among a handful of black faces
    appearing across the Mitchell & Kenyon collection of films, at a time long before
    mass immigration. As everyone gathers in Castle Street for Trafalgar Day at the
    base of Nelson's Column, with its endless bunting and union jacks, these images
    capture the sense of pride Liverpool - and Britain - felt for those who had fought
    for their nation.

    Graces' had yet to be built), towards the commercial centre of Liverpool, we pass
    by smartly-dressed city folk - many of whom look towards the camera in fascination.
