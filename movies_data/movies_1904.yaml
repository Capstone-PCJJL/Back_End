  overview: The scene represents the shop that rents garments for masquerades, A young
    student presents himself for the purpose of selecting a costume for a masked ball.
    The proprietor shows him several, which he refuses, one alter the other, for one
    reason or another. The costumer, furious at having found nothing to suit his client,
    who seemed hard to please, opens a hamper from which he draws the clothing of
    a clown, of an acrobat, of a musketeer, of a danseuse, and of various other personages
    which, as soon as he throws them down beside him, begin to move about and become
    animated, These animated costumes seize the student, deal him some hard blows,
    and shut him in the hamper from which they have come out. After terrific efforts,
    the unfortunate student extricates himself from the basket and throws himself
    upon what he supposes to be human beings, but his hand only grasps some tatters
    without consistence. They fall to the floor and he flies away in astonishment.

  overview: The Great Toronto Fire was a devastating blaze that destroyed 122 buildings
    and put 5,000 people out of work. The fire started in a clothing warehouse on
    Wellington Street and quickly spread, gutting thirteen acres of Toronto's prime
    commercial district. Special trains brought hundreds of firefighters from as far
    as Buffalo, New York. There was only one person injured -- the Toronto fire chief.
    Amazed firefighters and onlookers watched photographer George Scott and his assistant
    set up in the thick of the fire and film the burning buildings on Front Street.
    One of the first big Canadian film scoops, Scott's film was distributed throughout
    Canada and the United States.
