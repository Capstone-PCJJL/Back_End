    Then in quick succession the flags of Germany, Russia, Ireland, England and China
    are brought forth, and from each a soldier is produced corresponding with the
    flag of each nation. The magician adds a bit of comedy to the scene by producing
    a decidedly Hibernian policeman from the flag of Erin's Isle. The magician then
    waves his hand and the flags of all nations slowly dissolve and blend into one
    huge American flag.

    and sent them by special train to the scene of the ruins. Arriving at the scene
    of desolation shortly after the storm had swept over the city, our party succeeded,
    at the risk of life and limb, in taking about a thousand feet of motion pictures,
    although Galveston was under martial law and photographers were shot down at sight
    by the excited police. The series, taken as a whole, gives a definite idea of
    the most terrible disaster since the Johnstown flood of 1889.

    ride' (a popular early film genre for which the camera was mounted on a moving
    vehicle) offers glimpses of the harbour and lower Hong Kong in the distance as
    you descend from 400 meters. But as a funicular railway, the most heartstopping
    moment is the sight of the upward tram arriving on what looks like a collision

  overview: In the early days of films, most regional film showings happened at the
    fairground. The Travelling Cinematograph of Bioscope was a popular attraction,
    so it is no wonder that a camera was on hand to record this salvage operation.
    The film shows a Burrell's Showman's Road Locomotive - used for hauling fairground
    equipment from site to site - being rescued from a ditch. The sophistication of
    the shot sequencing suggests either a later filming date than 1900, or at the
    very least some fortuitous in-camera editing. As a record of an incident of life
    on the road for the early champions of film, it is invaluable.

  overview: Walter Gibbons was one of Britain's most forward-thinking film entrepreneurs,
    and deeply entranced by the music hall. In 1900 he launched his 'phono bio tableaux',
    which synchronised songs recorded by famous music stars on disc with a film of
    the performance. Sadly, all but one of the films are lost, making this last survivor
    a unique record of a major Victorian music hall star in sound and vision, as well
    as the oldest British 'sound film', nearly thirty years before the 'talkies' arrived.
    Lil Hawthorne, who performs this song, was a well-known American singer, often
    adopting a male persona, although she was not strictly a male impersonator.

  overview: At the opening of this picture, a couple are seen in dim outlines, spooning
    on a park bench. In comes a policeman, armed with a dark-lantern, which he suddenly
    flashes on the couple. They cease their love-making, in great confusion, and the
    policeman walks on, but as soon as he is out of sight, the couple commence billing
    and cooing again. This picture is particularly interesting because of the photographic
    effect of the sudden flashing of a dark lantern on the couple. It is very cleverly
    worked out, and the picture has made a big hit wherever it has been shown.

  overview: A dramatic scene - and exactly what moving pictures were invented for.
    With a fixed camera and without a traditional narrative, this film nevertheless
    tells a compelling story as a cast of men and boys fight an impending crisis.
    It's not known whether this fire was real or staged, but the tension is palpable
    as horse after horse emerges from the smoking barn. There's even comedy in the
    foreground as one man loiters at the pump a little too long, sloshing bucketloads
    of water on to the ground. (BFI.org.uk)
