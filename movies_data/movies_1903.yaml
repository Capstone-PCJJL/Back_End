  overview: In certain sections of New York City large numbers of Jewish and Italian
    push-cart vendors congregate so closely along the sidewalks that they interfere
    with traffic. Policemen keep them moving. The picture shows how the frightened
    peddlers hurry away when a bluecoat appears. Some of the carts are piled high
    with fruits of all kinds, and it is interesting and amusing to see the expressions
    of combined fear and anxiety on the faces of the men as they hurry away; the fear
    of being arrested if they stand, and of losing some of their wares if the carts
    strike an obstruction in the street. Very fine photographically. (Edison film

  overview: Siegmund Lubin's 1903 film illustrating The Outcast and the Bride survives
    and is the only vestige of Lubin's myriad attempts at coordinating sound and film
    extant today. With words by Howard Wall and music by Allen May, the song was published
    in Philadelphia by Joseph Morris. The morality tale of two friends, Kate and Alice,
    was a perfect vehicle for an illustrated song...Shot in Lubin's glass-enclosed
    studio atop 912 Arch Street, the film was originally 250 feet. The surviving footage
    at the Library of Congress contains six shots utilising four different sets but
    seems to be missing footage.

    in front of him and run into the surf and back to the beach again. As they reach
    the water with the girls on their shoulders, the breakers interfere with their
    progress and they fall head first into the water. Picking the girls up again,
    they make a dash for the beach, but many become exhausted before reaching the
    starting point, and let the girls fall. A number of girls are next shown, skylarking
    on the beach. A camera fiend, seeing a chance for a fine picture, sets up his
    camera and starts to focus it. The girls spy him, rush up behind the "fiend" and
    run both him and the camera into the water and give him a ducking. When pulled

    with the mistress, makes bold to ask for a kiss, and receives a slap for his pains.
    He is so startled that he bumps into the ladder on which the servant is working,
    throwing her to the ground, the ladder falling on top of her. She rises in her
    wrath and, seizing the bucket of water standing close by, she drenches the dude,
    spoiling his best Sunday clothes. Still smarting from the pain, she takes his
    walking stick and pounds him until he runs away. This will make you roar with
    laughter.

  overview: Five African Americans--three men and two women--perform a cakewalk, a
    dance featuring fancy strutting that was named after the prize awarded in the
    original contests. The dancers wear rather formal attire, with the men in dark
    suits and black tie and the women in full-length, high-collared dark dresses;
    one woman carries a small American flag. As they step in place against a light
    background, the center male--holding up a top hat and twirling a cane--moves toward
    the camera and briefly performs some fancy steps. As he moves back, the man at
    the left end of the line does a quick twirling step and links arms with his partner.
    The other two dancers also pair off as the center male leads them in a strutting
    movement around the stage. When they return to the original line, all five step
    towards the camera with the center man slightly ahead of the others. The film
    ends just as they stop the cakewalk.
